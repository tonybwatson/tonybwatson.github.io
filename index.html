                        The number one thing that held me back this week was <strong>stubbornness</strong>.<br>
                        I got stuck on one project and couldn’t focus on anything else until it was working. We had
                        three total projects this week - two of them focused on Bootstrap design, the other on
                        Javascript states.<br>
                        I got stuck on the JS project. <br>
                        In this project, I built a simple app to “guess” what number the user picked. The “guessing”
                        relied on simple math and multiples of nine. The app assigns a random symbol to multiples of 9,
                        which (when the user follows the mathematical instructions on-screen) should match the user’s
                        chosen number.<br>
                        I got the early stages of the project done fairly quickly, scrolling through the different pages
                        that were necessary by jumping through an array and displaying whichever page the user would be
                        on at any given time, but I became stuck trying to get the random numbers to appear correctly.
                        I spent the majority of my time dealing with problems on this specific project, leaving the
                        other two projects less complete than I’d have liked.<br>
                        One thing I’d like to learn more about Javascript is JSON. From the little bit that I’ve seen,
                        it looks like it’ll be helpful, but I know next to nothing about it. I’m also excited to start
                        working with frameworks that may help simplify some of the Javascript problems we’ve been
                        working on.<br>
                        In-person, Bootcamp is a much better experience than working remotely. Being able to just turn
                        to someone else in the room and ask if they have any idea what might be wrong with my code is
                        incredibly helpful. Also, having other people ask me for help tends to help me out with my code
                        problems as well - I see a problem someone else is having and I'm able to come up with ways to
                        potentially solve the problem before I encounter it myself. Seeing the problems that pop up and
                        different ways to solve them also gives me a better understanding of the languages we’re
                        using.<br>
                    </p>
                    <h3>On “Why”:</h3>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">
                        When I was a kid, I always assumed I’d end up working with computers.<br>
                        I caught Covid-19 in early December of 2020. I deteriorated rapidly - I could hardly walk from
                        one room to the next without resting or going into a coughing fit. I had a 102 fever, lost at
                        least ten pounds, and couldn’t eat anything of substance. Breathing was agony
                        and <em>everything</em> hurt. <br>
                        About ten days in, I lay in a cold tub, trying to get my fever to break, staring at the
                        ceiling. <br>
                        I thought I was going to die.<br>
                        <em>Not</em> great.<br>
                        My fever broke the next morning. My health steadily improved. Eventually, I was able to go back
                        to work. I recognized how much I dreaded returning when I realized I’d rather
                        have <em>died</em> than go
                        back. <br>
                        Okay, that’s maybe a <em>tad</em> hyperbolic. But I’d grown to hate my job.
                        The job was comfortable: decent pay, job security, coworkers were almost all fantastic. But I’d
                        been there for nearly half a decade and didn’t feel like what I was doing accomplished anything
                        worthwhile. I disliked sales (I was an insurance agent for the big green
                        lizard; <em>nobody</em> likes
                        dealing with insurance on <em>any</em> level.) I came home every day exhausted and angry. I was
                        a constant, irritable mess.<br>
                        I realized I’d felt his way for <em>years</em>, exhausted from dealing with the same
                        problems; people asking the same five questions over and over (“<em>What’s a premium? What does
                            my driving history have to do with anything? Why are you
                            asking me all of these questions; I just want a <strong>quote</strong>?!?</em>”)<br>
                        I’d become bitter.<br>
                        Toward the end of my illness, I had a discussion with my wife regarding a course she’d told me
                        about, offered by a company called Awesome Inc. It was a boot camp that taught web development
                        skills. <br>
                        It was a huge undertaking - 16 weeks, 8 am to 5 pm, participants couldn’t work elsewhere during
                        the camp. <br>
                        I did some research and found that Awesome offered an Intro to Web Development course that
                        introduced some basic information on web-dev. It wasn’t very expensive and, if I ended up taking
                        the bootcamp, the money I paid for the course would transfer to the bootcamp.<br>
                        The class was in the evening; it wouldn’t interrupt my work schedule.<br>
                        What did I have to lose?<br>
                        I signed up.<br>
                        It. Was. Awesome.<br>
                        I hadn’t learned anything particularly useful since college, and by the end of college, I was
                        just trying to get the degree and get out.<br>
                        But programming?<br>
                        Amazing! I could do so much, just by typing a few words and symbols. Fixing a problem felt like
                        a real accomplishment. That feeling of accomplishment was something I hadn’t felt at any job I’d
                        had, not really.<br>
                        For my final project in the intro course, I created a <em>Dungeons & Dragons</em> spellbook.
                        When I typed
                        in the name of a spell, the spell popped up as a Bootstrap card. It was buggy, but it worked. I
                        actually used it while playing the game with friends. <br>
                        I could make things that were useful. </p>

                        To be better.

                    <h3>Weekly Breakdown</h3>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">
                        This week was exhausting. We worked primarily on pseudocode (breaking down instructions for how
                        a
                        program should work into easily readable English.)<br>
                        I have trouble thinking in that way - my mind tends to jump back and forth between different
                        pieces of the project I'm working on, writing whatever code comes to mind at any given moment.
                        The first time I attempted the pseudocode project (writing out an everyday task in pseudocode),
                        I just wrote it out as code. I started again from the beginning and I feel that my second
                        attempt is much better.<br>
                        To improve my ability to pseudocode, I'll need to work on my ability to focus and break down
                        ideas into smaller pieces in a specific order, focusing on what needs to be done at each stage,
                        rather than just focusing on the overall project. I need to focus on simplification.<br>
                        This week we also worked on a project that created a game in which the player controls an Evil
                        Circle that causes bouncing balls to disappear.<br>
                        I had a ton of fun with this project. I hit several stretch goals - I made the objects wrap to
                        the other side of the screen when they went off the side; caused the bouncing balls to change
                        color and size when they collided with one another; and even implemented a "You win!" message
                        when the player gets rid of all of the balls, after which the game resets. With several sections
                        of this project (particularly the counter which shows how many balls remain on screen), I found
                        that pseudocode greatly aided me in breaking down exactly what needed to be done to solve the
                        problem in that given instance.
                        <br>
                        My biggest roadblock with this project was caused by a simple typing error. I spent around an
                        hour trying to get the bouncing ball game working again after I'd broken it trying to code the
                        EvilCircle. After what felt like hours (it was probably about a half-hour) of scanning through
                        the code, I realized I'd placed an additional set of parentheses.</p>

                    <h4>The original:</h4>

                    <code class="text-md-left p-4">EvilCircle.prototype = Object.create()(Shape.prototype);
    EvilCircle.prototype.constructor = EvilCircle;</code>

                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">The fixed version:</p>

                    <code class="text-md-left p-4">EvilCircle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
    EvilCircle.prototype.constructor = EvilCircle;</code><br>

                        After working on this project, I realized I may enjoy working in game design. I'll probably work
                        on simple side projects of my own and go from there.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <p class="text-md-left p-4">
                        The most helpful part of the onboarding process through Awesome Inc was the ability to work from
                        home at my own pace. I'm typically not a morning person; I get my best work done in the
                        afternoon and early evening. Working at home, I've been able to do everything at my own pace and
                        in my own time. Adjusting to this sort of workload over a month at more or less my own pace made
                        the process less painful.
                        <br>
                        Adjusting to the 8 am - 5 pm schedule in the coming weeks will be a challenge. Luckily, I've
                        prepared in practically every way I could - Meals are prepped, contingency plans are set up
                        (what if my car breaks down? What if...)
                        <br>
                        I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
                        <br>
                        The help channel on Slack was super helpful as well - being able to ask questions and to see
                        other bootcampers' questions is incredibly useful. Several times during onboarding I had a
                        problem or issue and opened up the help channel on Slack, only to see another bootcamper with a
                        similar problem already solved.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">
                        My biggest hindrance during onboarding was imposter syndrome. I tend to feel my work isn't good
                        enough - not just with regular code, but with other projects (including this blog.) I hate
                        putting my work and words "out there."</p>

                    <h3>On overcoming challenges:</h3>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">
                        My primary methods for overcoming challenges during onboarding were</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>"<strong>Google it</strong>" - If I encounter a problem, my first instinct is to search for
                            information on
                            how to fix that problem. The first few results for most of my code-related searches tend to
                            pull up information from MDN Web Docs, W3 Schools, or StackOverflow. The former two are the
                            preferred method of solving problems - MDN and W3 Schools give information on how processes
                            actually work, and while StackOverflow answers usually give working code, they often don't
                            give the best explanation for <em>why</em> it works.</li>
                        <li>"<strong>Throw stuff at the wall and see what happens</strong>" - This only works for
                            problems about which I
                            already have a little bit of knowledge. If I know a bit about what <em>should</em> fix the
                            problem,
                            I can usually work it out eventually.</li>
                        <li>"<strong>Ask for help</strong>" - I've always had a problem asking for help. I'd rather not
                            admit I have a

                        So ends yet another exciting week of work for Awesome Inc's Bootcamp. I feel like I'm getting a
                        better grasp on Javascript overall, though I have *so much more* to learn. I spent a ton of time
                        this week debugging code to my "<a
                            href="(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)">rubber duck</a>" (actually an
                        Awesome Inc. branded
                        stress-ball pig, pictured below) - I'm quite confident my wife thinks I've lost my mind.
                    </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/pig-picture.jpg" class="img-fluid"

                    <hr>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">
                        The first project we worked on this week was a story generator. The generator takes a paragraph
                        of text and replaces various parts of the string (“<code>:insertx:”, “:inserty:</code>", etc.)
                        with other
                        strings to make a story that changes when you press a button. To change these strings, the
                        generator pulls strings from a series of arrays. <br>

                        I got through the project without much trouble - just a bit of Googling and talking to the pig.
                        I pondered for a while over a string that needed to be replaced twice, before remembering a
                        [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) kata I worked on in early August that required replacing
                        all instances of a string using only one line of code.
                        I used `replaceAll()` to change both instances of the string without re-running the same code
                        twice.<br>

                        I may update the CSS on this project at a future date - it's pretty hideous as of now.
                    </p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">
                        I spent two straight days working on this week’s second project, an alarm clock. <br>

                        I was able to get the time to appear without <em>too</em> much trouble: <br>

                        I created a function to show the time. To start, I created variables to pull in the date, and to
                        pull the hours, minutes, and seconds as variables from the date.</p>
                    <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                        function updateTime() {
                        var date = new Date();
                        
                        var hour = date.getHours();
                        var minute = date.getMinutes();
                        var second = date.getSeconds();
                    </code>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">From there, I converted from military to standard time by
                        subtracting 12 from the hours if they were higher than 12 (So, for example, if the hour appeared
                        as 14, it would subtract 12 to get 2 o'clock.) Also, if the hour is 0, I converted it to 12 -
                        midnight.</p>
                    <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                        if (hour > 12) {
                            hour = (hour - 12);
                        } else if (hour == 0) {
                            hour = '12';
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4">When I tested this, I noticed the hours and minutes
                        appeared as single numbers when they were not 10 or higher. (Ex: 953 to show 9:05:03) This
                        simply wouldn't do. I had to add a zero in front of minutes or seconds less than 10. I added a
                        zero in front of the hour as well, for uniformity and to keep the other digits on the clock from
                        moving awkwardly to the right when the hour changed from single to double-digits.</p>
                    <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                        if (hour &lt 10) {
                            hour = '0' + hour;
                        }
                        if (minute &lt 10) {
                            minute = '0' + minute;
                        }
                        if (second &lt 10) {
                            second = '0' + second;
                        }
                    </code>
                    <p class=" text-md-left p-4"></p>With that sorted, I needed to format this information
                    to appear as it would on a clock, adding colons between hour/minute/second - so I made a variable,
                    `currentTime` (and also added in `<span>` to help the CSS for an animation on the colons):</p>
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                            var currentTime = `${hour}<span class="blink">:</span>${minute}<span class="blink">:</span>${second}`;
                        </code>
                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4"></p>Finally, I needed to display the time in the HTML:
                        </p>
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                                document.getElementById('time').innerHTML=currentTime;
                                }
                            </code>
                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4"></p>And with that, we had a way to display the time.

                        <em>"Easy."</em> <a src="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=%2FS">/s</a>

                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4">But the time didn't update without refreshing the page.

                            For that, I needed to use `setInterval()`:</p>
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                            setInterval(updateTime, 1000)
                            </code>
                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4">And with that, I had a clock that updated every 1000
                            milliseconds.<br>

                            My next challenge was getting the alarms to work. <br>

                            My first attempt at alarms ran directly from HTML, like so: <br>

                            HTML: </p>

                        <button onclick="setTimeout(alarm, 600000)">TEN MINUTE ALARM</button>

                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4">JS: </p>
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                            function alarm() {
                            document.getElementById('alertSound').play();
                            alert('!');
                            }
                        </code>
                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4"></p>This used the button click to call the alarm
                        function to set off a sound file and an alert. This technically worked, but I read this week
                        that calling the function from HTML is not considered "best practice." The alarm sound and the
                        visible alert also ran a few seconds apart, which wasn't great.

                        I had to do something else.

                        I removed the function call from HTML and moved the calls to Javascript:

                        HTML: </p>
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                            <button id="eightHour">EIGHT HOUR ALARM</button>

                            <button id="tenMinute">TEN MINUTE ALARM</button>
                                    
                            <button id="tenSecond">TEN SECOND ALARM</button>
                        </code>
                        JS:
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                            // variables to run different alarms
                            var eightHour = document.getElementById('eightHour');
                            var tenMinute = document.getElementById('tenMinute');
                            var tenSecond = document.getElementById('tenSecond');

                            // function calls for alarms

                            tenSecond.onclick = setTimeout(alarm, 10000);
                        </code>
                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4"></p>The alarms ran instantly every time I clicked the
                        alarm buttons, even though I'd included `setTimeout()` to make them wait a set amount of time
                        before running. I struggled with this for a long while.
                        With input from Awesome Inc instructor Justin Hall, I switched to inline functions, like so:
                        </p>
                        <code class="text-md-left p-4">
                            eightHour.onclick = function () {setTimeout(alarm, 28800000);}
                            tenMinute.onclick = function () {setTimeout(alarm, 600000);}
                            tenSecond.onclick = function () {setTimeout(alarm, 10000);}
                        </code>
                        <p class=" text-md-left p-4"></p>And thus the alarms worked with the proper
                        countdowns.

                        I was able to get buttons for specific time increments working - 8 hour, ten-minute, and
                        ten-second test alarms, but I've thus far been unable to get an alarm to set for a specific time
                        of day.<br>

                        Roughly a third of my time on this project was spent on CSS - I found an excellent font for the
                        clock numbers, and for the sound, I used the classic <a
                            src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXieXlAbpQg">alarm from every 80's clock
                            radio</a>.<br>ß

                        Once I have a better grasp of Javascript, I intend to come back to this project and set up an
                        alarm that can be set for a specific time of day - for example, by typing in a specific time of
                        day. I’d also like to incorporate a dark/light theme button, as well as responsive CSS.
                        </p>
