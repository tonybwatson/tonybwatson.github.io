We're starting by learning to use the command line, Codeanywhere and Github. I knew absolutely nothing about any of these before we started, and after a bit of practice I'd consider myself "in need of tons more practice".

No Dunning-Kruger effect here.

I'm excited to become more familiar with Codeanywhere and Github, as well as the use of the command line - we're starting way outside my "comfort zone" of HTML and CSS. I'm assuming by the end of bootcamp I'll be fairly proficient with all the systems we've been working with this week.

One last note... Reading through the list of commands for the terminal made me better understand this comic I remembered from XKCD...<br></br>

Sudo (SuperUser Do) allows users to perform tasks that require administrative permissions. So basically he's forcing the other stick figure to make the sandwich.<br></br>
