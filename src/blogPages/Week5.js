						The number one thing that held me back this week was <strong>stubbornness</strong>.<br />
						I got stuck on one project and couldn’t focus on anything else until it was working. We had
						three total projects this week - two of them focused on Bootstrap design, the other on
						Javascript states.<br />
						I got stuck on the JS project. <br />
						In this project, I built a simple app to “guess” what number the user picked. The “guessing”
						relied on simple math and multiples of nine. The app assigns a random symbol to multiples of 9, 
						which (when the user follows the mathematical instructions on-screen) should match the user’s chosen number.<br />
						I got the early stages of the project done fairly quickly, scrolling through the different
						pages that were necessary by jumping through an array and displaying whichever page the user
						would be on at any given time, but I became stuck trying to get the random numbers to appear
						correctly. I spent the majority of my time dealing with problems on this specific project, leaving
						the other two projects less complete than I’d have liked.<br />
						One thing I’d like to learn more about Javascript is JSON. From the little bit that I’ve
						seen, it looks like it’ll be helpful, but I know next to nothing about it. I’m also excited to
						start working with frameworks that may help simplify some of the Javascript problems we’ve
						been working on.<br />
						In-person, Bootcamp is a much better experience than working remotely. Being able to just
						turn to someone else in the room and ask if they have any idea what might be wrong with my
						code is incredibly helpful. Also, having other people ask me for help tends to help me out with
						my code problems as well - I see a problem someone else is having and I'm able to come up with
						ways to potentially solve the problem before I encounter it myself. Seeing the problems that pop
						up and different ways to solve them also gives me a better understanding of the languages we’re
						using.<br />

					<h4>On “Why”:</h4>
					<p className="card-text text-start">
						I caught Covid-19 in early December of 2020. I deteriorated rapidly - I could hardly
						walk from one room to the next without resting or going into a coughing fit. I had a 102 fever,
						lost at least ten pounds, and couldn’t eat anything of substance. Breathing was agony
						and <em>everything</em> hurt. <br />
						About ten days in, I lay in a cold tub, trying to get my fever to break, staring at the
						ceiling. <br />
						I thought I was going to die.<br />
						<em>Not</em> great.<br />
						My fever broke the next morning. My health steadily improved. Eventually, I was able to go back
						to work. I recognized how much I dreaded returning when I realized I’d rather have <em>died</em> than go back. <br />
						Okay, that’s maybe a <em>tad</em> hyperbolic. But I’d grown to hate my job. The job was comfortable: decent pay, job security, coworkers were almost all fantastic. But I’d
						been there for nearly half a decade and didn’t feel like what I was doing accomplished
						anything
						worthwhile. I disliked sales (I was an insurance agent for the big green
						lizard; <em>nobody</em> likes
						dealing with insurance on <em>any</em> level.) I came home every day exhausted and
						angry. I was a constant, irritable mess.<br />
						I realized I’d felt his way for <em>years</em>, exhausted from dealing with the same
						problems; people asking the same five questions over and over (“<em>What’s a premium?
						What does my driving history have to do with anything? Why are you
						asking me all of these questions; I just want a <strong>quote</strong>?!?</em>”)<br />
						I’d become bitter.<br />
						Toward the end of my illness, I had a discussion with my wife regarding a course she’d told me
						about, offered by a company called Awesome Inc. It was a boot camp that taught web development skills. <br />
						It was a huge undertaking - 16 weeks, 8 am to 5 pm, participants couldn’t work elsewhere during the camp. <br />
						I did some research and found that Awesome offered an Intro to Web Development course
						that introduced some basic information on web-dev. It wasn’t very expensive and, if I ended
						up taking the bootcamp, the money I paid for the course would transfer to the bootcamp.<br />
						The class was in the evening; it wouldn’t interrupt my work schedule.<br />
						What did I have to lose?<br />
						I signed up.<br />
						It. Was. Awesome.<br />
						I hadn’t learned anything particularly useful since college, and by the end of college,
						I was just trying to get the degree and get out.<br />
						But programming?<br />
						Amazing! I could do so much, just by typing a few words and symbols. Fixing a problem
						felt like a real accomplishment. That feeling of accomplishment was something I hadn’t felt at any
						job I’d had, not really.<br />
						For my final project in the intro course, I created a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>
						spellbook. When I typed in the name of a spell, the spell popped up as a Bootstrap card. It was buggy, but
						it worked. I actually used it while playing the game with friends. <br />
						I could make things that were useful. </p>
					<h3>So, why am I doing this?</h3>
					<p class="card-text text-start">
						To get a job where I can feel like I’m doing something useful.<br />
						To prove to myself that I can do this.<br />
						To be better.
