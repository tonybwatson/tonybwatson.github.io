						We've reached the halfway point of the in-person portion of bootcamp.
						The biggest hurdle I've had so far has been adapting to React. I had a ton of trouble early on in adapting to "thinking in React", which caused me to feel like I was falling behind.
						I feel like I've caught up, but I spent much of the last couple of weeks wondering if I'd made a terrible mistake in trying to do this.
						Next week, we're starting to learn PHP, so it's back to square one. 
						I feel like each week, I'm mostly lost until around Thursday afternoon around 2:00, when suddenly most of what we've learned during the week seems to click for me.
						So that's something.

						For my final project, I'm still at a bit of a loss as to what I'll do.
						I've considered something with tabletop gaming - maybe a toned-down version of Roll20, the online tabletop gaming site - but honestly I'm still on the fence about what I'm doing.
						Luckily, I still have a few weeks to think about it before I need to nail down what I'm going to do.

// How has React caused you to rethink 
// websites and apps?

// Now that you are halfway through 
// bootcamp, what has been the biggest 
// hurdle that you have gone past? What 
// do you think is going to be the next 
// biggest thing to power through?

// Compared to earlier, what are 
// three ideas you might want to do for 
// your final project? Are they the same 
// ideas as before, or have they changed 
// now that you understand more about 
// the technology and your limitations?
