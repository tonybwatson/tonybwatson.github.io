This week has certainly been __*Awesome*__‚Ä¶

I managed to take a vacation *and* complete all my work - **the joy of working remotely**! I flew to San Diego, getting a lot of work (mostly reading) done on the flights.  Despite the in-flight wifi not working, I was lucky enough to have most of the tabs for the reading open when the flight took off. A 3-hour layover in Atlanta definitely helped me find time to get work done too.

This week in the bootcamp, we did quite a bit of work in HTML and CSS, which I consider to be my ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù - I have a decent amount of experience from working with both in the Intro to Web Development course I took this spring before starting the Awesome bootcamp. Even so, I picked up quite a few new things, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a ton I can‚Äôt even conceive of at this point.

We did a bit of work on all of ‚Äúthe big three‚Äù (HTML, CSS, JS) in Grasshopper, a fantastic online learning program. The earliest lessons in Grasshopper start by giving you chunks of Javascript (in my opinion, the most challenging of the three by far) that you have to put in order, eventually working up to writing your own code. The system holds your hand a bit, especially in the beginning, but it is informative throughout. 

The module for this week contained information about Agile software development, which is a specific set of principles to create software in the best way possible.
I‚Äôd try to sum up the manifesto, but I feel it‚Äôs best to post it in its entirety - it‚Äôs only 68 words:

The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions¬†over processes and tools

Working software¬†over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration¬†over contract negotiation

Responding to change¬†over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left¬†more.

Pretty straightforward. 

The main project we worked on this week was a module on structuring a page of content using semantic elements. The module provides a page of HTML content and a CSS stylesheet. The two have to be linked by placing semantic elements in the HTML to match those in the CSS. As they're placed, the page rearranges itself into a more aesthetically pleasant website.

You can find the code for my completed site [here](https://github.com/tonybwatson/birdwatching).

Semantic elements include tags such as article, main, header, footer, etc. The type of semantic element describes what type of content should be placed within it. For example, a header typically contains introductory content like a logo or headings; footers generally contain author info, copyright information, etc. 

More in-depth info on semantic elements can be found at [W3Schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

The biggest takeaway for me this week was the power of Chrome‚Äôs dev tools. They can be used to see what changes to CSS would look like, without having to directly change the CSS file. 

Going forward with this information will make changing CSS much easier in the future - it‚Äôs a far cry faster than my standard operating procedure of ‚Äúmake change in CSS, save CSS file, load in browser, repeat.‚Äù 
Dev tools can also be used to see what various pseudoclasses look like, and those pseudo classes can be turned on and off at will. Pseudo classes include ```:hover```, ```:visited```, and ```:active```. Basically, these are states when an element is affected by something - for example, hovering the mouse cursor over a button changing that button's color.

I picked up on a lot of stuff this week that I didn't in the Intro course.

I‚Äôm at a point in my coding journey where I don‚Äôt know **what** I don‚Äôt know. I hardly know what is possible, so I‚Äôm unsure of what I'm doing or where I'm going. Other bootcampers *(Is "bootcampers" the right word?)* keep mentioning ideas I'd never even thought about. For example, in one of our standup sessions this week, another bootcamper, Michael Chinn, mentioned he‚Äôd been working on trying to use PHP to convert Markdown to HTML and well...

I struggle with imposter syndrome and explaining myself in general. 
When I encounter a problem, I tend to Google the answer first.  As I progress further in the bootcamp, I'm learning more relevant keywords and sites to find help faster.  When all else fails, it's nice to have our Slack group available to bounce ideas off of.  
I have trouble knowing when a project is ‚Äúgood enough.‚Äù I can figure out how to do most tasks, but explaining how I got to my answer/finished product has always been a problem for me, which is unfortunately not an answer the otherwise omnipotent Google can provide. Hopefully I'll be able to improve upon that lack of self-confidence as the bootcamp continues.

## Week One
### 8/25/2021

Thus far, my first week hasn't been what I'd expected. I figured we'd be starting with HTML, CSS, something along those lines. 

We're starting by learning to use the command line, Codeanywhere and Github. I knew absolutely nothing about any of these before we started, and after a bit of practice I'd consider myself "in need of tons more practice". 

No [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) here. 

I'm excited to become more familiar with Codeanywhere and Github, as well as the use of the command line - we're starting way outside my "comfort zone" of HTML and CSS.
I'm assuming by the end of bootcamp I'll be fairly proficient with all the systems we've been working with this week.

One last note... Reading through the list of commands for the terminal made me better understand this comic I remembered from XKCD...

![XKCD comic - A stick-figure tells his friend "Sudo make me a sandwich"](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sandwich.png)
###### Sudo (SuperUser Do) allows users to perform tasks that require administrative permissions. So basically he's forcing the other stick figure to make the sandwich.

*Still* not funny. üôÑ
